# Conversation Analysis and Keyword Management System

This project is a **Node.js** and **Express**-based application that allows users to perform **conversation analysis** and manage **keywords** effectively. It connects to a **MongoDB** database using **Mongoose** and provides various utilities for sentiment analysis, grammar checks, keyword detection, and keyword extraction.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Create and delete users, with validation for unique usernames and user IDs.
- **Keyword Management**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve keywords associated with specific users. Keywords are stored and linked to individual users to personalize keyword detection.
- **Conversation Analysis**: Analyze user conversations for:
  - **Sentiment**: Detect and score the sentiment of a given text.
  - **Grammar**: Provide grammar suggestions and corrections.
  - **Keyword Detection**: Detect user-defined keywords within conversations.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract and count keyword occurrences from given text inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing users and keywords.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library to interact with MongoDB.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis on conversations to gauge positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Grammar Check**: Grammar correction feature for analyzing text.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Integrated keyword extraction to generate word counts.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up your MongoDB connection. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a connection string in the `app.js` file:

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/LIF");
    ```

5. Start the application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:8888/`.

## Folder Structure

- **Controllers**: Contains business logic for users, keywords, and conversation analysis.
- **Models**: Defines the Mongoose schemas for users and keywords.
- **Routes**: Manages the application routing for user, keyword, and conversation analysis features.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users can create an account with a unique username and user ID.
   - Users can manage their keywords (add, update, and delete).
   - Users can initiate conversation analysis by providing the necessary text input and requesting specific features such as sentiment analysis or keyword detection.

2. **Conversation Analysis**:
   - Text conversations are analyzed for sentiment and grammar.
   - Keywords defined by the user are detected in conversations.

3. **Keyword Management**:
   - Keywords are associated with users and can be added, updated, or removed.
   - Keywords can also be extracted from text inputs to generate word frequency data.

## Future Improvements

- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication for secure access to the system, including password hashing and session management.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Enhance the analysis capabilities by adding more components such as topic detection, intent analysis, and named entity recognition to provide deeper insights into conversations.
- **User Interface**: Build a user-friendly front-end interface to allow non-technical users to interact with the system. This can include dashboards, charts, and visualizations for keyword frequency, sentiment trends, and conversation insights.
- **Integrations**: Add integrations with messaging platforms like Slack, WhatsApp, or email for real-time conversation analysis and keyword monitoring.
- **Data Visualization**: Introduce visual tools such as graphs and word clouds for better comprehension of keyword occurrences and sentiment distribution across conversations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve system performance by optimizing MongoDB queries and enhancing real-time analysis for faster feedback.
- **Keyword Categorization**: Provide the option to categorize keywords into groups, enabling users to manage and detect groups of keywords simultaneously for better organization and analysis.
- **API Documentation**: Improve API documentation to make it easier for developers to integrate this system into other applications.
